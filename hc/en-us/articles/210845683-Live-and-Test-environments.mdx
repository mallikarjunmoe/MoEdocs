title: "Live and Test environments"
description: "Your MoEngage account has two different environments, Test and Live, with a single Workspace ID (available under Settings > Account > General settings) that is used as a MoEngage identifier."

The MoEngage SDKs (Android, iOS, and Web) direct the user data or event data to:

- The Test environment when the build is *DEBUG*
- The Live environment when the build is *RELEASE*

When you integrate an app or web for the first time or update it, you can test all new changes, such as event tracking, in the Test environment and update the app or release the web in the Live environment. 

When you begin integrating any MoEngage SDKs, all your testing of user data or events data is visible in the Test environment. This enables you to test your integration and verify data before you go live or release your app or web.

You can switch between Live and Test environments by selecting the environment on the top navigation bar.

## Test Environment

The following are the advantages of the Test environment:

- All team members added to the Test environment have all feature permissions in the Test environment. Everyone can experiment with different scenarios.
- All test data in the Test environment is processed and reflected faster, which saves time during initial integration and makes debugging easier.
- You can easily maintain and test different settings—Push FC, Event Trigger DND, Uninstalls—for Test and Live environments without any mutual impact.

## Live Environment

After you complete integration and decide to release your app or take your website live, mobile SDKs of MoEngage will detect the RELEASE build and send all live user data or event data to the Live environment.

The Live environment has feature restrictions for different access roles to prevent any mistakes or changes by any of your team members that can impact live user data and campaigns:

- Developers must specifically mark certain users as test users before they can create campaigns or run any segmentation queries in the Live environment. For more information, refer to [Test Users in LIVE Environment](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/210836083).
- Developers cannot change Push FC and DND settings in the Live environment.
