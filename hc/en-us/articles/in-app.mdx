<Tabs>
<Tab title="On session start">
Select On session start to display the In-App message as soon as a user's app session begins. An app session starts when the user first interacts with the app. The session ends if the user logs out, enters from another traffic source, or is inactive for longer than the defined inactivity period (default is 30 minutes).

<Frame></Frame>

Under Select trigger time, select Immediately to send the message as soon as the campaign is published, or select After Delay to send the message after a specified time.

<Note>

The After Delay option is available in the following SDKs:

Android SDK version 6.9.0 or later

iOS SDK 4.11.1 or later

React Native SDK 8.6.0 or later

Cordova SDK 8.4.0 or later

Capacitor SDK 3.1.0 or later

This trigger condition is available in the following SDKs:

</Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="On screen load">
Select On screen load to display the In-App message on a specific screen or app context.

<Frame></Frame>

Under Select screen/In app context, you have the following options:

<Frame></Frame>

Any screen (Earlier on app open): The message appears as soon as the app opens on any screen where showInApp() or showNudge() is explicitly called. If these methods are not present on the initially opened screen, the message does not display until the user navigates to a screen where these methods are called. For instance, if your app has ten screens and you have added the methods to five screens, the message displays on every screen where these methods are added. Add relevant delivery controls to your campaign to prevent the message from appearing on all screens where the methods are present. For more information on delivery controls, refer here.

Specific screens: After selecting Specific screens, configure the screens or app context based on the platforms you selected. For your In-App message, you can configure either the screen, the app context, or both.

Screen: An application can contain multiple screens, such as login, home, product, and checkout screens. Under the Android and iOS tabs, choose where the In-App campaign should display. Select screens from the Screen is any of list. You can select a maximum of five screens. This is an OR condition, so the message displays on any one of the selected screens.

App context: A context is a section or part of a screen where you can display messages. For example, a podcast screen can have two contexts: For you and All episodes. To display the In-App campaign on the desired app context, add the context name in the App context is any of field. This is an OR condition, so the message displays on any one of the app contexts. For more information on context, refer to Android and iOS.

<Frame></Frame>

Under Select trigger time, select Immediately to send the message as soon as the campaign is published, or select After Delay to send the message after a specified delay.

<Note>
Note

You must add the showInApp() or showNudge() method to your screens for the In-App message to appear. For more information, refer to Display In-App.

You can set a maximum delay of 1 day (86400 seconds) and a minimum delay of 1 second with the After Delay option.

The After Delay option is available only for In-App Android SDK version 6.9.0 or higher and In-App iOS 4.11.1 or later.

Existing campaigns with the old trigger criteria On app open are migrated under On specific screen trigger and under Any screen.

Screen fetch behavior:

For Android: MoEngage automatically fetches the selected screen from your app through the MoEngage SDK.

For iOS: You must enter the screen name where the In-App message should display.

This trigger condition is available with the following SDKs:

Android SDK version 9.0.0 or later

iOS SDK version 6.06.0 or later

This trigger condition is currently available only for native Android and iOS. It does not support hybrid platforms.
</Note>
</Tab>

<Tab title="On custom event">
Select On custom event to display In-App messages when a user performs a specific custom event.

<Frame></Frame>

IF user
In this section, select the event condition for your In-App campaign. MoEngage sends the In-App campaign if a user performs this event. You can add multiple events and attributes.

From the Select an event list, select the event.

Beginning with In-App Android SDK version 8.1.0 and In-App iOS SDK version 5.0.1.1, you can add multiple OR conditions within events by clicking + Trigger. For example, display the In-App message to users who have clicked in-app on mobile at least one time.

<Frame></Frame>

You can also refine the custom event:

Click + Attributes to add attributes to the filter.

From the Select attribute drop-down list, select the attributes and the logical drop-downs for the selected attribute.

To add more attributes:

Click + Attribute.

Click AND or OR.

From the Select attribute list, select the attributes and the logical drop-downs for the selected attribute.

For instance, if you select the event User installs the app, you can add the attribute App Version to filter for users who installed a specific version of the app.

<Frame></Frame>

AND then
You can add more customization with the AND then feature. In addition to the + Trigger option, the + Filter button enables you to string multiple events together.

For instance, you can select the In-App Clicked Android event and then use the AND then option to add the Added to Cart event.

By doing this, the In-App campaign displays to users who have clicked an In-App campaign on their mobile device at least once AND then proceeded to add an item to their cart at least once.

<Frame></Frame>

You can also define the time to wait before the event in the Filter condition evaluates. Setting this limit to 15 minutes implies that the user must perform the Filter event within 15 minutes of performing the first trigger event. In this example, the first event is In-App Clicked Android. You can set a maximum delay of 24 hours and a minimum delay of 1 minute here.

<Frame></Frame>

If you click + Filter again, you can add another event to the trigger criteria. You get the option to choose AND or OR. Combine the two filter conditions by choosing AND, or use the OR to filter users if they perform any of the events within the time limit.

<Frame></Frame>

THEN
In the THEN section, under Trigger the message, select an option to define when to display the message. The available options are:

Immediately: The message displays immediately after the trigger criteria are met.

After Delay: The message displays after the defined delay.

<Frame></Frame>

Trigger criteria summary: This section summarizes the trigger based on the events and attributes you select, making it easier to understand the trigger criteria.

<Frame></Frame>

<Note>
Note

You must not select the same event with the Filter and use the Then option. This will show an error message and your campaign will not run.

The AND then option is available only for In-App Android SDK version 8.1.0 or higher and In-App iOS 5.01.1 or higher.

When After Delay is selected, a maximum delay of 1 day (86400 seconds) and a minimum of 1 second delay can be set.

The After Delay option is available only for In-App Android SDK version 6.9.0 or higher and In-App iOS 4.11.1 or higher.

Events received from Data API or any other server-side source are not supported as a trigger action in the custom event.

In-session Attributes
In-session attributes enable you to group and target users based on their actions within the current app session. For example, use in-session attributes to display onboarding flows exclusively to new users visiting your app for the first time. This method ensures that these users receive a customized experience immediately during their initial session.

<Frame></Frame>

Use And/Or to combine multiple in-session attributes.
<Frame></Frame>

Select the Exclude Users check box to exclude users based on their in-session activity.

You can use the following in-session attributes with your In-App campaign:

Query Parameter: This attribute segments users based on query parameters in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Typically, users land on your personalized URL by clicking an advertisement on any social media platform.

You can use UTM parameters to segment users based on their source or the campaign that led them to the URL.

UTM parameters like utm_source identify campaigns driving users to websites. You can use UTM and custom parameters to segment users and personalize their experience.

User Type: This attribute segments users based on whether they are new or returning. The SDK stores user details (unique_id) for each user in the app storage. A user is considered a Returning User if the associated user details exist in the SDK data storage. Otherwise, the user is considered New. If the user clears the app cache, they are considered new.

Note: If two users (User 1 and User 2) use the same device and User 2 logs in after User 1, User 2 is considered a returning user.

Day of the Week: This attribute segments users based on the day of the week they visit your app.

Time of the Day: This attribute segments users based on the hour of the day they visit your app. You can choose from any of the one-hour slots available in the list.

GeoLocation: This attribute segments users based on their geolocation when they visit your app. You can choose the country, state/region, and city where the user is located or exclude a specific country.

Control Group

Conversion Goals
You can add conversion goals to track business metrics for your campaigns, with a maximum of five goals. Choose any app event as a conversion goal activity. The first goal is treated as a primary goal.

For example, if you want to track the number of customers who purchased an iPhone after your campaign was sent (Event: Purchase event, Product: iPhone), your conversion goal setup might resemble the following image:

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a funnel for your user actions. For example, use multiple conversion goals to check:

How many users viewed the product page?

How many added that product to the cart?

How many made a successful order?

| With MoEngage, you can track the revenue generated by your campaigns. To track revenue performance, enable the Revenue performance toggle for the conversion goal for which you want to track the revenue. In this example, to track revenue for orderSuccessful events, enable the Revenue performance toggle. | <Frame></Frame> |
| After choosing the goal, select the numeric attribute that captures the order's total monetary value. In this example, cartValue contains the total order value. You can choose the currency in which your monetary value is reported. | <Frame></Frame> |
| Set Attribution window: Set an attribution window (a time period calculated from when the user receives/clicks the campaign, for which you want to attribute conversion goals to a specific campaign). By default, it is set for 36 hours, while the maximum attribution window can be set up to 10 days. | <Frame></Frame> |

<Accordion title="Delay Between Two Campaigns">
If you have multiple In-App campaigns, you can stagger them by setting a minimum delay between messages from different campaigns. Go to Settings > Channels > Delivery controls.

Note: This minimum delay applies to messages from different campaigns and the same campaign.

Here you can set the minimum delay (in minutes) between two In-App messages from different campaigns. With this setting, if your user sees a message from Campaign 1 at time T and another message is sent before T+15, it does not display.
