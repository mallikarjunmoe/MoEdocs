# Set Up 2-Step Verification on Your Device

Two-step verification (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your MoEngage account by requiring a second form of authentication.

## What is 2-Step Verification?

2-Step verification requires two forms of identification:
1. Something you know (your password)
2. Something you have (your mobile device or authenticator app)

## Setting Up 2FA

### Step 1: Access Security Settings
1. Log into your MoEngage dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Security
3. Click on "2-Step Verification"

### Step 2: Choose Authentication Method

#### SMS Authentication
1. Enter your mobile phone number
2. Receive a verification code via SMS
3. Enter the code to verify

#### Authenticator App
1. Download an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
2. Scan the QR code displayed on screen
3. Enter the 6-digit code from the app

### Step 3: Save Recovery Codes
1. Download and save your recovery codes
2. Store them in a secure location
3. These codes can be used if you lose access to your device

## Managing 2FA

### Disabling 2FA
1. Go to Security settings
2. Click "Disable 2-Step Verification"
3. Confirm the action

### Changing Phone Number
1. Update your phone number in security settings
2. Re-verify with the new number

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Device
