# Overview

On-Site Messaging (OSM) campaigns allow you to deliver personalized, in-the-moment messages directly on your website. Use OSM to engage users based on their behavior, page visits, or other in-session attributes. This guide walks you through setting up an OSM campaign in MoEngage.

# Steps to Create an OSM Campaign

Creating an OSM campaign involves three main steps:

1.  [Target users](#step-1-target-users): Select the audience for your campaign.
2.  [Define content](#step-2-define-content): Create the message for your campaign.
3.  [Schedule and goals](#step-3-scheduling-and-goals): Configure when the campaign delivers and what actions to track.

## Step 1: Target Users

This section allows you to define who sees your On-Site message and when they see it.

### Campaign details

Use these fields to manage and identify your campaign:
- **Campaign name**: Enter a name for the campaign. The name must have at least five characters and a maximum of 256.
- **Campaign tags**: Select up to five tags from the list to categorize your campaign. For more information, refer to [Campaign Tags](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058057412).

Select the platforms where your campaign will appear:
- **Web**: Select this option to target your website.
- **Mobile Web**: Select this option to target your mobile website.

</Frame>

### Trigger criteria

Define when your On-Site message will display to users:

#### On page load
Select this option to show the message as soon as a page loads on your website.
- **Immediately**: Displays the OSM as soon as the page loads.
- **After Delay**: Displays the OSM after a specified delay (for example, 2 seconds after page load).
- **After Scroll**: Displays the OSM after the user scrolls a specified percentage of the website (for example, after scrolling 30% of the page).
<Frame>
  <img src="/guide-media/01GXZRCS8V8APSBHSREAWXD6CK" alt="On Page Load trigger options" width="512" height="226" />
</Frame>

#### On custom event
You can display On-Site messages when a user performs a specific custom event. Choose to send the message immediately or after a delay.

  <img src="/guide-media/01J7XC1GHBTG3R5TBKWDG44FZR" alt="On Custom Event trigger options for On-Site Messaging" width="571" height="445" />
</Frame>

#### If user
The **If user** section allows you to select an event that triggers the message. You can add multiple events and attributes to refine the conditions. To define events:

1.  From the **Select an Event** list, select the event.
2.  To refine the event:
    - Click **+ Attributes** to add attributes to the filter.
    - Select the logical drop-downs for the attribute (for example, "is equal to," "is not equal to").
    - To add more attributes, click **+ Attributes** button.
    - Select **AND** or **OR** to combine conditions.
    - From the attributes list, select the attributes and their logical drop-downs.

<Frame>

</Frame>

#### AND then
Use the **AND then** feature to combine multiple events for more precise targeting. For instance, trigger a message only for users who have clicked an On-Site message AND then added an item to their cart.
<Frame>
  <img src="/guide-media/01J7XCCT1F8EEZNVY9885JHKA3" alt="Combining multiple trigger events with AND then condition." />
</Frame>
You can also define a time limit for the subsequent event.

#### THEN
In the **THEN** section, define when to show the message:
- **Immediately**: The message displays as soon as the trigger criteria are met.
- **After Delay**: The message displays after a specified delay.

<Info>
When you select **After Delay**, you can set a maximum delay of 1 day (86,400 seconds) and a minimum delay of 1 second.
</Info>

#### On exit intent
Select this option to trigger a message when a user attempts to leave your website. For more information, refer to [Exit Intent Technology](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043881431).

# FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to use a custom font in the OSM editor?">
    Integrating custom fonts enhances visual appeal and maintains brand consistency.

    #### 1. Host your font file
    Ensure your font file is on a publicly accessible URL, e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf`.

    #### 2. Prepare your template
    Select the template you want to customize within the OSM Editor.

    #### 3. Modify text settings
    1. Click the text element you want to change.
    2. Open its settings, go to the **Advanced** tab, and enter a unique **CSS Id**, like `text_id1`.

    #### 4. Add an embed element
    Insert an embed element into your template. This element will be invisible and is used only to add custom CSS.

    #### 5. Insert custom font code
    In the embed element, input the following CSS, replacing the URL and font family name:
    ```html
    <style type="text/css">
      @font-face {
        font-family: 'YourCustomFontName';
        src: url('https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf'); /* Your font URL */
      }
      #text_id1 p {
        font-family: 'YourCustomFontName' !important;
      }
    </style>
    ```

    #### 6. Customize additional elements
    To apply the font to other elements (like buttons), assign them a unique CSS ID (e.g., `button_id1`) and add it to the CSS selector:
    `#text_id1 p, #button_id1 span { ... }`

    #### 7. Preview and publish
    Preview your template to confirm the font displays correctly, then publish your campaign.
