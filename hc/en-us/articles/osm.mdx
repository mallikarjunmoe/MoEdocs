# Overview

On-Site Messaging (OSM) campaigns allow you to deliver personalized, in-the-moment messages directly on your website. Use OSM to engage users based on their behavior, page visits, or other in-session attributes. This guide walks you through setting up an OSM campaign in MoEngage.

# Steps to Create an OSM Campaign

Creating an OSM campaign involves three main steps:

1. [Target users](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23step-1-target-users): Select the audience for your campaign.

2. [Define content](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23step-2-define-content): Create the message for your campaign.

3. [Schedule and goals](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23step-3-scheduling-and-goals): Configure when the campaign delivers and what actions to track.

## Step 1: Target Users

This section allows you to define who sees your On-Site message and when they see it. It includes the following settings:

### Campaign details

Use these fields to manage and identify your campaign:

<div class="table-with-image" border="0">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: "59.8335%"}}>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Campaign name</strong>: Enter a name for the campaign. The name must have at least five characters and a maximum of 256.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Campaign tags</strong>: Select up to five tags from the list to categorize your campaign. For more information, refer to <a href="[https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058057412](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058057412)" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Campaign Tags</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style={{width: "40.1665%"}}>
<img src="/guide-media/01GY7A73CJ10HJGTEKD0PPW22X" alt="Campaign_Details_OSM.png" width="234" height="137" />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Target platforms

Select the platforms where your campaign will appear:

<div class="table-with-image" border="0">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: "63.2857%"}}>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Web</strong>: Select this option to target your website.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Web</strong>: Select this option to target your mobile website.
</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style={{width: "36.7143%"}}>
<img src="/guide-media/01GW1KFA3987BMV7FAM31F9JKQ" alt="OSM_TargetPlatforms.png" width="194" height="60" />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Trigger criteria

Define when your On-Site message will display to users:

#### On page load

Select this option to show the message as soon as a page loads on your website.

* **Immediately**: Displays the OSM as soon as the page loads.

* **After Delay**: Displays the OSM after a specified delay (for example, 2 seconds after page load).

* **After Scroll**: Displays the OSM after the user scrolls a specified percentage of the website (for example, after scrolling 30% of the page).

#### On custom event

You can display On-Site messages when a user performs a specific custom event. Choose to send the message immediately or after a delay.

#### If user

The **If user** section allows you to select an event that triggers the message. You can add multiple events and attributes to refine the conditions.

To define events in the **If user** section:

1. From the **Select an Event** list, select the event.

2. To refine the event:

   * Click **+ Attributes** to add attributes to the filter.

   * Select the logical drop-downs for the attribute (for example, "is equal to," "is not equal to").

   * To add more attributes, click **+ Attributes** button.

   * Select **AND** or **OR** to combine conditions.

   * From the attributes list, select the attributes and their logical drop-downs.

   For example, if you select the *User installs the app* event, you can add an attribute called *App Version* to filter for users who installed a specific app version.

#### AND then

Use the **AND then** feature to combine multiple events for more precise targeting. For instance, you can select the *On-site Message Clicked* event and then use the **AND then** option to add the *Added to Cart* event.

With this setup, the On-Site message appears only to users who have clicked an On-Site message campaign at least once AND then added an item to their cart at least once.

You can also define the time to wait before the event in the **Filter** condition is evaluated. Setting this limit to 15 minutes means the user must perform the Filter event within 15 minutes of the first trigger event (for example, *On-site Message Clicked*).

* The maximum delay you can set is 24 hours, and the minimum delay is 1 minute.

If you click the **+ Filter** button again, you can add another event to the trigger criteria. Choose **AND** to combine conditions, or **OR** to filter users if they perform any of the events within the time limit.

#### THEN

In the **THEN** section, under **Trigger the message**, select an option to define when to show the message:

* **Immediately**: The message displays as soon as the trigger criteria are met.

* **After Delay**: The message displays after a specified delay. For example, if you set a 2-second delay, the OSM will appear 2 seconds after the page loads.

<Info>
**Information**

When you select **After Delay**, you can set a maximum delay of 1 day (86,400 seconds) and a minimum delay of 1 second.
</Info>

**Trigger Criteria Summary**: The Trigger Criteria Summary provides an overview of the selected trigger events and attributes, helping you easily understand the campaign's trigger logic.

#### On exit intent

Select this option to trigger a message when a user attempts to leave your website. For more information, refer to [Exit Intent Technology](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043881431).

### Select pages

This section allows you to choose which web pages display the campaign. You can select one of the following options:

* **All pages**: The campaign displays on all website pages.

* **Specific pages**: The campaign displays on specific website pages. You define which pages to show or hide the campaign on by setting URL rules.

To show or hide your campaign on specific pages using the URL path:

1. Click **Specific pages**.

2. Under **If URL**, select a condition from the **Select Option** list:

</Info>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### In-session attributes

In-session attributes allow you to group and target users based on their actions within their current website session.

For example, if a user is in India, you can show them a personalized pop-up created for Indian users. This helps deliver an immediate, personalized experience within the same session.

To add an in-session attribute, click **+ In-session attributes**.

You can combine multiple in-session attributes and exclude users based on their in-session activity.

You can use the following in-session attributes with your On-Site campaign:

1. **Query Parameter**: Segment users based on URL query parameters. Typically, users would land on your personalized URL by clicking an advertisement on any Social Media platform

   * You can use UTM parameters (Source, Medium, Content, Campaign) to segment users by traffic source.

   * UTM parameters like `utm_source` and `utm_campaign` help identify which campaigns drive users to your website. You can use UTM and custom parameters to segment users and personalize their website experience.

2. **User Type**: Segment users based on whether they are new or returning. The Web SDK stores user details (`unique_id`) in the browser. If these details exist, the user is returning; otherwise, they are new.

   * If the browser cache is cleared, the user is treated as new.

   * If two users are using the same device and user 2 logs in after user 1, they would be considered a returning user.

   * If a user logs in from a mobile browser and then from a desktop browser, the desktop login counts as a new user.

3. **Day of the Week**: Segment users based on the day they visit your website.

4. **Time of the Day**: Segment users based on the hour they visit your website. Choose from available one-hour slots.

5. **Geolocation**: Segment users based on their geographic location (Country, State/Region, City). You can also exclude specific countries.

6. **Device Type**: Segment users based on their device (Mobile, Desktop, or Tablet). You can include or exclude one or a combination.

7. **Operating System**: Segment users based on their device's operating system (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, or others). You can include or exclude one or a combination.

8. **Browser Type**: Segment users based on their browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, or others). You can include or exclude one or a combination.

### Campaign audience limit

This feature helps you control campaign reach and expenditure by capping the number of users who receive it based on engagement metrics like sends, impressions, and conversions. You can set total, daily, or instance-level limits for campaigns. For more information, refer to [Campaign Audience Limit](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/35579781173012-Campaign-Audience-Limit#h_01JP4SSADV881HJE0QB5PYYG36).

### Control groups

Use these settings to exclude users in control groups from your campaign:

<div class="table-with-image" border="1">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: "70.4286%"}}>
<ul>
<li>
Enable the <strong>Global control group</strong> toggle to exclude users in the global control group from the campaign's target segment.

### Conversion goals

Add up to five conversion goals to track business metrics for your campaigns. You can choose any app event as a conversion goal activity. The first goal you set becomes the primary goal.

For example, if you want to track how many customers purchased an iPhone after your campaign, your conversion goal setup might include:

* **Goal Name**: *iPhonePurchase*

* **App Event you wish to track**: *Made Purchase*

* **Event Attribute/Property**: *product* is an *event attribute/property*

* **Value of Event Attribute/Property**: *iPhone*

With multiple conversion goals, you can track more than one business metric or visualize a user action funnel. For example, you can track:

* How many users viewed the product page.

* How many of them added that product to their cart.

* How many of them successfully completed an order.

<Accordion title="Tracking Revenue Performance (Optional)">
MoEngage allows you to track revenue generated by your campaigns. To track revenue performance, enable the **Revenue Performance** toggle for the desired conversion goal.
<div class="table-with-image" border="0">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style={{width: "57.5714%"}}>
For example, to track revenue for <strong>orderSuccessful</strong> events, enable the <strong>Revenue performance</strong> toggle. After choosing the goal, select the numeric attribute that captures the order's total monetary value (for example, <strong>cartValue</strong>). You can also choose the currency in which your monetary value is reported.
</td>
<td style={{width: "42.4286%"}}>

<tr>
<td style={{width: "57.5714%"}}>
After selecting the goal, choose the numeric attribute that captures the total monetary value of the order. In the example, <strong>cartValue</strong> contains the total order value. You can also choose the currency in which your monetary value is reported.

<td style={{width: "57.5714%"}}>
<strong>Set Attribution window</strong>: Define the time period after a user receives the campaign during which conversion goals are attributed to that campaign. The default is 36 hours. For example, if you set it to 5 hours.

### Campaign priority and delivery controls

This section contains the following options:

* **Campaign Priority**: Set one of the following priorities: **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, **Normal**, and **Low**. If a user is eligible for two campaigns simultaneously, the one with higher priority displays. If both have the same priority, the most recently created campaign displays first.

* **Global Delivery Control**: Enable this toggle to ignore the global minimum delay settings for the On-Site Messaging channel.

* **Local Delivery Controls**: These options specify delivery controls specific to this campaign:

  * **Maximum times to show a message**: Define how many times a user can see the On-Site message from this campaign. MoEngage tracks this using the **On-site Message Shown** event in the user's profile. For example, if you publish a campaign with this option off and later set it to "one time," users who already saw the message before the edit will not see it again.

  * **Minimum delay between 2 messages on this campaign**: Set the minimum time gap between two On-Site messages from the same campaign.

  * **Auto dismiss message after 'x' seconds**: Specify the time after which the On-Site message will disappear from the URL.

Your campaign is now ready. Click **Publish** and confirm in the dialog box to create the campaign.

Once you successfully create the campaign, the Campaign Info page displays.

# FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How to use a custom font in the OSM editor?">
Integrating custom fonts into your OSM templates enhances visual appeal and maintains brand consistency. Follow these steps to use custom fonts:

#### 1. Host your font file
Ensure your custom font file is hosted on a secure domain or a publicly accessible URL. For example: `https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf`

For demonstration, use this Roboto font link: `https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/roboto/v30/KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu5mxKKTU1Kvnz.woff2`

Clicking the URL should start a download, confirming the font file is hosted correctly.

#### 2. Prepare your template
Select the template you want to customize within OSM Pro.

![select template.png](/guide-media/01HVF5KM2TV5B7F5AD08N8E7YB)

#### 3. Modify text settings
1. Click the text element where you want to apply the custom font:
2. Click the settings icon (![Settings__1_.png](/guide-media/01GYAC9X1684RGZ0J6DMC0C5YV)), then select the styling icon (![Styling.png](/guide-media/01GYACF4JRK9D0KPF7M5V9A2M1)).
   ![click on settings.png](/guide-media/01HVF5Y1K5X0KKM58TMAPHWMES)
3. Switch to the **Advanced** tab.
   ![switch to advanced tab.png](/guide-media/01HVF5Y5WF6SBV1TAXMXRDD12G)
4. In the **CSS Id** field, enter a unique identifier, such as `text_id1`.
   ![add identifier.png](/guide-media/01HVF5Y0V4XA895QY19XH6ZAFC)
5. Close the settings menu after adding the identifier.

#### 4. Add an embed element
Insert an embed element into your template. This element will not be visible to users; it only modifies the font style within the template.

![embed element.png](/guide-media/01HVF5Y5CY94TFSG8T14X1PD6B)

#### 5. Insert custom font code
Click the previously added embed element and input the following CSS:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTML">

```css
<style type="text/css">
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'customfont';
    src: url('[https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf](https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf)'); /* Your font URL */
  }
  #text_id1 p {
    font-family: 'customfont' !important;
  }
</style>
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This code imports your custom font named 'customfont' from a specified URL and applies it to paragraphs within the element with ID `#text_id1`, ensuring the custom font is used regardless of other styles.

![Add custom code.png](/guide-media/01HVF68SEZVYW6YS6HEPYSJP67)

#### 6. Customize additional elements
To change the font for other elements, such as buttons:
1. Assign a unique ID to the button, for example, `button_id1`.
   ![change button identifier.png](/guide-media/01HVF66Q9D2GAZ6BD73ZCPKMCY)
2. Modify the CSS code to include the button ID:
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="HTML">

```css
<style type="text/css">
@font-face {
  font-family: 'customfont';
  src: url('[https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf](https://yourdomain.com/fonts/yourfont.ttf)');
}
#text_id1 p, #button_id1 span {
  font-family: 'customfont' !important;
}
</style>
```

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    This CSS code defines a custom font named 'customfont' loaded from a specified URL and applies it to text within elements identified by `#text_id1` and `#button_id1`, ensuring the custom font is used regardless of other styles.
   
    ![button code.png](/guide-media/01HVF66M980790FHS99940WVPJ)

#### 7. Preview and publish
After adding the CSS, preview your template to confirm the font displays correctly. Once verified, you can publish your campaign.
