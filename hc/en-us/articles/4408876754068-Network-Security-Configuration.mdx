<Note>
**Note**

  This section is only required if you have a custom Network Security Configuration in your application.
</Note>

If your application has a network security configuration that whitelists domains to which your application can send data to whitelist the below domains based on the MoEngage Data Center you have selected while integrating the SDK.

| Data Center | Host |
|:--- |:--- |
| DATA\_CENTER\_1 | sdk-01.moengage.com |
| DATA\_CENTER\_2 | sdk-02.moengage.com |
| DATA\_CENTER\_3 | sdk-03.moengage.com |
| DATA\_CENTER\_4 | sdk-04.moengage.com |
| DATA\_CENTER\_5 | sdk-05.moengage.com |
| DATA\_CENTER\_6 | sdk-06.moengage.com |

By default, the SDK sends the data to *DATA\_CENTER\_1*. In case, you have not configured any data center while initializing the SDK whitelist the host corresponding to *DATA\_CENTER\_1*
