# Recovery Codes

Recovery codes are backup authentication codes that allow you to access your MoEngage account when you can't use your primary two-factor authentication method.

## What are Recovery Codes?

### Purpose
Recovery codes serve as a backup authentication method when:
- **Lost Device**: Your phone or authenticator device is lost
- **Broken Device**: Your device is damaged and can't access 2FA apps
- **App Issues**: Your authenticator app is not working
- **SMS Problems**: You're not receiving SMS codes
- **Network Issues**: You can't access your 2FA method

### How They Work
- **One-Time Use**: Each code can only be used once
- **Limited Quantity**: You receive a limited number of codes
- **Secure Access**: Provide secure access without your device
- **Immediate Access**: Allow immediate account access

## Generating Recovery Codes

### When You Set Up 2FA
1. **Enable 2FA**: Set up two-factor authentication
2. **Generate Codes**: System automatically generates recovery codes
3. **Download/Save**: Download or copy the codes immediately
4. **Secure Storage**: Store codes in a secure location
