# Live and Test Environments

MoEngage provides separate environments for testing and production use, allowing you to safely test campaigns and features before deploying them to your live users.

## Environment Types

### Test Environment
- **Purpose**: Safe testing of campaigns and features
- **Data**: Uses test data and limited user base
- **Campaigns**: Test campaigns don't affect real users
- **Analytics**: Separate analytics for test activities

### Live Environment
- **Purpose**: Production environment for real users
- **Data**: Real user data and full functionality
- **Campaigns**: Live campaigns sent to actual users
- **Analytics**: Production analytics and reporting

## Switching Between Environments

### Environment Toggle
1. Look for the environment selector in the top navigation
2. Click to switch between "Test" and "Live"
3. Confirm the environment switch
4. The dashboard will refresh with the selected environment

### Visual Indicators
- **Test Environment**: Usually indicated with a "Test" badge or different color
- **Live Environment**: Standard interface without test indicators
- **Current Environment**: Always displayed in the navigation bar

## Working with Test Environment

### Benefits of Testing
- **Safe Experimentation**: Test new features without risk
- **Campaign Validation**: Verify campaigns before going live
- **Integration Testing**: Test SDK integrations safely
- **User Experience**: Validate user flows and messaging

### Test Data Management
- **Test Users**: Create dedicated test user accounts
- **Sample Data**: Use sample data for testing
- **Limited Scope**: Test with a small subset of users
- **Clean Environment**: Keep test data separate from production

## Best Practices

### Before Going Live
1. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test campaigns in test environment first
2. **Validate Content**: Check all messaging and creative assets
3. **Review Targeting**: Verify audience segmentation
4. **Check Timing**: Ensure proper scheduling and time zones

### Environment Management
- **Regular Testing**: Use test environment for regular testing
- **Documentation**: Keep track of what was tested
- **Team Coordination**: Ensure team members know which environment they're using
- **Data Cleanup**: Regularly clean up test data

## Common Issues

### Environment Confusion
- **Problem**: Accidentally creating campaigns in wrong environment
- **Solution**: Always check the environment indicator before creating campaigns

### Data Synchronization
- **Problem**: Test and live data getting mixed up
- **Solution**: Use separate test user accounts and data sets

### Campaign Deployment
- **Problem**: Forgetting to test before going live
- **Solution**: Establish a testing checklist and process

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Test Environment**: May have different access controls
- **User Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions for each environment
- **Data Privacy**: Protect test data as you would production data

### API Keys
- **Separate Keys**: Use different API keys for test and live environments
- **Key Management**: Keep track of which keys belong to which environment
- **Security**: Rotate keys regularly and securely
