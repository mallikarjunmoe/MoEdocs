description: "MoEngage maintains multiple data centers, and when you sign up with MoEngage, your account (workspace) is added to a specific data center. Your MoEngage account's login URL is based on the MoEngage data centers. For more information, refer to [Data Centers in MoEngage](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057030512)."

The MoEngage *single login page* or *global login page* allows you to navigate to your MoEngage account's login URL from a global login page, regardless of which data center your account is hosted in. This allows faster logins, reduces errors, and ensures a smoother login experience.

## Use Cases

- If you forgot your MoEngage account's login URL after signing up with MoEngage or did not bookmark it, you can easily find it from the MoEngage single login page.
- If you are a part of multiple MoEngage accounts, based on your last used account, you will be automatically redirected to the relevant login method and data center.
- If Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled on your last used account, you will be automatically redirected to the Login with Single Sign On page on the last used account. Your email address is automatically populated on this page.
