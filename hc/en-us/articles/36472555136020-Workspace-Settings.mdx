    On the General settings page, enter the following details:
    
    | Section | Field | Description |
    |:--- |:--- |:--- |
    | Basic details | Workspace ID (earlier app id) | This is a unique ID that MoEngage has assigned to your current workspace. It is a read-only field.<br/><br/>The developers in your organization need this Workspace ID when:<br/>- Integrating the SDKs<br/>- Authenticating the API requests |
    | Basic details | Time zone | The time zone is automatically selected based on your current time zone. Select a different time zone if required.<br/><br/>Choosing the appropriate time zone ensures that messages or notifications are delivered to users at the right time, based on their local time zone. |
    | Goal mapping | Conversion goal | A conversion goal is a specific action you want your users to complete. This could be anything from a product purchase, a sign-up, a content view, or any other key interaction that signifies progress or value within your business objectives. You can define this goal to track how effectively your campaigns drive desired user behavior.<br/><br/>After you select a conversion goal, you must select an attribute in the **Revenue attribute** field.<br/><br/>You must select the conversion goal and revenue attribute to see insights on conversions. Configured attributes are displayed as conversion metrics on the Key Metrics dashboard. For more information, refer to [Key Metrics](https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/33185178907028-Key-Metrics#h_01JFFBCVQAYAYXE0VJ9YJGFENH). |
    | Goal mapping | Revenue attribute | A revenue attribute is a specific data associated with a user's action that indicates the monetary value generated by that action. For example, if your conversion goal is a "product purchased," the revenue attribute would be "price" to measure the amount of money spent on that purchase.<br/><br/>This field is dependent on the **Conversion goal** field. After you select a conversion goal, the revenue attributes related to that goal are available in this list. |
    | Goal mapping | Currency | Setting the right currency is important for providing accurate pricing information, offers, and promotions to customers. Displaying prices in their local currency enhances the customer's experience and eliminates confusion or discrepancies. It also helps build trust and credibility by presenting information in a familiar and understandable format.<br/><br/>This field is dependent on the **Revenue attribute** field. After you select a revenue attribute, the available currencies are displayed in this list. |
