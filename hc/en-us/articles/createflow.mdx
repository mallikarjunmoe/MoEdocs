# Option 1: Create a Flow Using a Flow Template
Flow templates provide you with inspiration for crafting your flows based on your goals - onboarding, incentivization, and engagement.You can create single-channel or multiple-channel flows for sending reminders for abandoned carts, reach out to customers who are a churn risk, and improve app/website engagement. The various Flow templates are discussed below :

## Template Types
There are two basic template types

*   **Adoption**: Adoption templates can be used for onboarding new customers and are available for a single channel and multiple channels.
*   **Engagement**: Engagement templates are available for single, multiple, or specific channels such as the web and app. They can be used for improving app or website engagement, engaging with customers who have looked up certain offerings or added certain products to their carts and abandoned them, and reaching out to customers who are a churn risk.

You can choose one of the following templates when creating a flow:

| Template Type | Template Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adoption | Onboard Customers - Single Channel | Use this template to welcome new customers and guide them in their journey with your product or service. This template makes use of a single channel for communicating with customers during their onboarding phase and nudging customers towards their first purchase once they've onboarded. |
| Adoption | Onboard Customers - Multi-Channel | Use this template to welcome new customers and use multiple channels to communicate with customers. You can leverage the power of A/B testing to identify the best channel to communicate with new users (and use this information for other onboarding Flows). This template also employs locales and conditional splits to identify the local language of the users and communicate with them in the same language. |
| Engagement | Abandoned Cart Reminder - Single Channel | Use this template to send a reminder to users who have added items to their cart but have yet to make a purchase. The template uses the Wait For/Till Node element to send the nudge after a time delay (the user is sent the nudge only post a fixed time interval after they add the items to the cart) and checks if the user has abandoned the cart or made a purchase post the set interval before sending the communication. This template employs a single channel for communication. |
| Engagement | Abandoned Cart Reminder - Multi Channel | Use this template to nudge users who've abandoned their carts towards making a purchase by employing multiple channels. |
| Engagement | Browse Abandonment - Multi-Channel | Use this template to engage with customers who've viewed products or looked up specific categories of products but haven't made a purchase yet. This template will help you send contextual communication and you get to leverage the power of Intelligent Path Optimization (IPO) to distribute users automatically to the best performing path intelligently using Sherpa. |
| Engagement | Customer Reactivation - Multi-channel | Use this template to engage with customers who haven't been active on your platform for quite some time. This template helps you send curated offers and communicate with dormant customers. Since the Next Best Action (NBA) is employed in this template, communication is sent to each customer in the channel that they are most likely to engage with and at the time that they are most likely to do so. |
| Engagement | Periodic Customer Reactivation - Multi-channel | Use this template to engage with dormant customers in a periodic manner (every ten days). This template leverages the power of NBA to communicate with each customer in their preferred channel at the time that they are most likely to engage in that channel. |
| Engagement | Engage customers on App | Use this template to engage with customers who haven't been on their app for a few days using NBA. The template uses in-app and card campaigns to nudge customers towards a purchase once they are on the app. |
| Engagement | Engage customers on Web | Use this template to engage with customers who haven't been on their app for a few days using NBA. The template uses a combination of Web Push, On-site messaging, Cards and Google Ads to nudge customers towards a purchase once they are on the app. |

Now that you know the types of templates, you can use them to create flows.

<Info>
**Information**
* You can edit the Flow template to add event checks wherever necessary and edit the campaign content.
* You can add or delete stages to the template as required.
</Info>

## Use a Template
1.  Select the flow template and click **Use template**.
2.  Add entry conditions, define the target audience, and conversion goal (if any) for the flows.
3.  Review the campaigns in the template and modify them as required.
4.  Add new stages or paths if necessary, as per the business use case.
5.  After the structure of your flow is ready, you can click **Save** to save it as a draft. To publish the flow, your next action depends on your account's settings:
    *   If the Campaign Approval workflow is disabled, you can publish the flow directly.
    *   If the Campaign Approval workflow is enabled, you have the permission to create, manage, and publish campaigns, you can publish the flow directly .
    *   If the Campaign Approval workflow is enabled and you only have the **Create & Manage** permission, you must submit the flow for approval. For more information, refer [here](/hc/en-us/articles/26100424636436#h_01K0E4E6XW2QY4X7HVPQMGJA1W).

# Option 2: Create a Flow from Scratch
You can start with a blank canvas and build a flow of your choice. The following are the steps to create a flow from scratch:

1.  [Details and goals](/hc/en-us/articles/26100424636436#h_01HWK15KM97Q81E3AGRN9E1XB6): Define the goal of the flow and add the required details.
2.  [When will users enter the flow](/hc/en-us/articles/26100424636436#h_01HY96AJ7AZ39EWA7E6C6PD3B1): Define when the users will enter the flow.
3.  [Who will enter the flow](/hc/en-us/articles/26100424636436#h_01HWK1D8AFVM5D2B8363KM786T): Define the audience of the flow.

### Limit User Entry Settings
<Info>
When you select **At fixed time** under the **Users enter the flow** section, the **Limit user entry into this flow** toggle is visible only when you select a **Periodic** option.
</Info>

To limit the number of times a user enters the flow, turn the **Limit user entry into this flow** toggle on and enter a value in the following fields:

1.  Define the maximum entry limit. For example, 2 times.
2.  Configure the frequency. For example, 1 month. The range can be from a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 1 year (both inclusive).

![Flow user entry 1.png](/guide-media/01HR612RA47GJP5HDRF5VCRWKS)

| Frequency | Example | How It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day(s) | Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 5 Day(s) | A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time before 08:35AM on January 6, 2024. |
| Week(s) | Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 1 Week(s) | A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time until 7 days are passed from 08:35AM January 1, that is, 08:35AM on January 8, 2024. |
| Month(s) | Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 1 Month(s) | A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time until 30 days are passed from 08:35AM January 1, that is, 08:35AM on January 31, 2024. <br/><br/> **Note:** If you select the **Month(s)** option, MoEngage considers 30 days regardless of the number of days in that month. |
| Year(s) | Maximum number of entries per user: 2 time(s) in 1 Year | A user who enters a flow at 08:35AM on January 1, 2024 can enter the flow for a maximum of one more time until 365 days are passed from 08:35AM January 1, that is, 08:35AM on December 31, 2024. |

### Global Exit Criteria
Under **Flow Exit**, turn the **Exit based on conditions** toggle on to define flow exit conditions. When the users fulfill the conditions defined, MoEngage removes them from their last known position in the flow regardless of where they are. The exit criteria are applicable for all flow types (for example, **On event trigger**, **At fixed time**, **On flow exit**, and **On business event trigger**).

![Screenshot 2024-07-29 at 3.35.49 PM.png](/guide-media/01J3YZ8TG5KFJGBNT394PA1CSM)

MoEngage evaluates users on these conditions right from the time they enter the flow to the time they exit the flow due to reasons such as:

*   Passing through an exit stage in the flow path
*   Fulfilling the conditions in the exit criteria
*   Achieving the conversion goal defined in the flow

You can define the exit criteria using events triggered by users or user properties that you track for them:

![Screenshot 2024-07-29 at 3.35.49 PM.png](/guide-media/01J3YZAXCQPEHTWDKK892K9496)

*   **User property**: On the **User property** tab, you can define the exit criteria using user properties by specifying a value for a specific attribute. For example:
    *   Remove users when their membership is Gold (this can be used when the flow has a fixed agenda to convert users to Gold Membership).
*   **User behavior**: On the **User behavior** tab, you can define the exit criteria using the list of events tracked in MoEngage.For example:
    *   Remove users when they have purchased any product after entering the flow
    *   Remove users when they have purchased the same product that they added to their cart after entering the flow
        *   You can achieve this and similar use cases by linking the primary trigger event and the Exit Condition. For more information, see [Linked Conditions](/hc/en-us/articles/21099281569300)
    *   Remove users when they have purchased the same product that is now back in stock.

#### Supported Filters
You can define exit criteria only using conditions that are of string, integer, and Boolean data types.

<Warning>
**Warning**

MoEngage does not support the conditions defined with following filters:
*   Custom segments
*   Affinity segments
*   Array type and GeoPoint
*   Special Date Filters (Daily where the hour, Weekly where the day, Monthly where the day, Yearly where the month, Yearly where the date)
*   last n weeks, hours, months
*   last n days where n> or equal to 30 days
*   Sherpa-based attributes

If you use a filter that is not supported, an error message will be displayed. You will have to select a filter that is supported to fix the issue.

![Screenshot 2024-07-29 at 3.43.22 PM.png](/guide-media/01J3Z02E3MTD36SCRXRD9QB0F9)
</Warning>

Click **+ Add exit condition** to include additional conditions, with a limit of five conditions. Each condition will be evaluated using OR logic with the others. If the users fulfills any of these conditions (in any order), they will exit the flow. For example, if the users fulfill the Condition 3 first, they will exit the flow even though they have not fulfilled the Condition 1.

![Screenshot 2024-07-29 at 3.41.39 PM.png](/guide-media/01J3YZM47BYD5M8PEFZ0NWHGHY)

Within each condition, you can add sub-conditions. Click **+ Filter** to add more conditions. You can add a maximum of five sub-conditions. Each sub-condition will be evaluated using AND logic with the others. Only If the users fulfills all conditions, they will exit the flow.

![Screenshot 2024-07-29 at 3.43.16 PM.png](/guide-media/01J3YZQ5K078BBN7W9C3VAFSZ6)

<Info>
**Information**

If there are multiple sub-conditions used in a condition, users must fulfill all sub-conditions within a 30-day period in any order to satisfy the exit condition. For example, in Condition 1, you have defined the following sub-conditions.
*   Has Executed App/Site Opened at least 1 time
*   Last Seen Date is on July 25, 2024
*   Last Known City is New York

![7.png](/guide-media/01J3KXJ48H5C64D4JBV72Y9BJC)

If the users fulfill the fist two conditions on August 1, 2024, they do not exit flow immediately. MoEngage waits for 30 days from August 1 for the last condition to be fulfilled. If it happens before August 31, the users will exit the flow. If it happens on September 2, the users will not exit the flow because the first two conditions are outside the 30-day window.
</Info>

You can edit an exit criteria even after you publish the flow. However, MoEngage creates a new version of the flow in this case. This is not applicable for one-time flows.
