## What is a Beta Release?

MoEngage does a beta release when the product feature is complete and all the development is done but the feature may have some bugs and performance issues. This release is mostly done for users who want to test the product, use it cautiously, and report bugs.

## What is a Closed or Open Beta Release?

When the product or feature in beta is exposed to all the customers, it is called an Open Beta Release. When the product or feature in beta is exposed only to a limited or closed group of customers, it is called a Closed Beta Release.

## What does a Beta Feature Mean for MoEngage Users?

If you are seeing any beta product or feature, you are among the users or clients who would have either requested the feature, or the Product team at MoEngage would have considered the product or feature relevant to you.

You must be cautious while using any beta feature because it might have some low-impact bugs that might have escaped testing (QA). It will be great if you report any bugs or performance issues that you face while using the product or features in beta. It will help MoEngage to improve your experience and deliver a bug-free product.
